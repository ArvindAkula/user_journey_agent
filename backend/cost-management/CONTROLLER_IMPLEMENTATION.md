# Resource Controller Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the `ResourceController` class that orchestrates all AWS service managers for unified cost management operations.

## Implementation Details

### File Created
- `backend/cost-management/controller.py` - Main controller module (650+ lines)

### Classes Implemented

#### 1. ResourceController
Main orchestration class that coordinates all service managers.

**Initialization:**
```python
controller = ResourceController(
    project_name="user-journey-analytics",
    environment="prod",
    region="us-east-1",
    state_file="config/aws-resource-state.json",
    s3_bucket=None,  # Optional S3 backup
    dry_run=False
)
```

**Key Methods:**

1. **stop_all_resources(dry_run=None) -> OperationResult**
   - Stops all managed AWS resources to minimize costs
   - Operation order:
     1. Save current resource state
     2. Stop Lambda functions (set concurrency to 0)
     3. Reduce Kinesis stream shards
     4. Disable CloudWatch alarms
   - Returns detailed operation result with cost savings estimate
   - Supports dry-run mode for safe testing

2. **start_all_resources(dry_run=None) -> OperationResult**
   - Starts all managed AWS resources from stopped state
   - Operation order:
     1. Load saved resource state
     2. Enable CloudWatch alarms
     3. Restore Kinesis stream shards
     4. Start Lambda functions (remove concurrency limits)
     5. Verify resources are operational
   - Returns detailed operation result
   - Supports dry-run mode for safe testing

3. **get_resource_status() -> ResourceStatusReport**
   - Queries status from all service managers
   - Calculates total estimated costs (hourly, daily, monthly)
   - Generates comprehensive status report
   - Identifies idle resources
   - Provides cost optimization recommendations

4. **save_state() -> bool**
   - Saves current resource configurations to state file
   - Collects configurations from all service managers
   - Persists to local JSON file
   - Optional S3 backup

5. **restore_state() -> bool**
   - Restores resources from saved state file
   - Loads state from StateManager
   - Applies configurations to all service managers
   - Returns success status

#### 2. OperationResult
Data class for operation results (stop, start).

**Fields:**
- `success`: Overall operation success
- `operation`: Operation type (stop/start)
- `timestamp`: Operation timestamp
- `resources_affected`: List of affected resource names
- `errors`: List of error messages
- `warnings`: List of warning messages
- `cost_impact`: Estimated cost impact (savings for stop)
- `duration_seconds`: Operation duration
- `service_results`: Detailed results per service

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()`: Serialize to dictionary for JSON export

#### 3. ResourceStatusReport
Data class for status reports.

**Fields:**
- `timestamp`: Report timestamp
- `overall_status`: Overall resource status (running/stopped/unknown)
- `total_resources`: Total number of managed resources
- `running_resources`: Number of running resources
- `stopped_resources`: Number of stopped resources
- `estimated_hourly_cost`: Estimated hourly cost
- `estimated_daily_cost`: Estimated daily cost
- `estimated_monthly_cost`: Estimated monthly cost
- `service_status`: Status details per service
- `recommendations`: List of optimization recommendations

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()`: Serialize to dictionary for JSON export

## Service Manager Integration

The controller integrates with three service managers:

1. **KinesisManager** - Manages Kinesis Data Streams
   - Stop: Reduce shard count from 2 to 1
   - Start: Restore shard count to 2
   - Estimated savings: ~$0.36/day

2. **LambdaManager** - Manages Lambda functions
   - Stop: Set reserved concurrency to 0
   - Start: Remove concurrency limits
   - No idle cost (only charged on invocation)

3. **CloudWatchManager** - Manages CloudWatch alarms
   - Stop: Disable alarm actions
   - Start: Enable alarm actions
   - Minimal cost impact (~$0.03/day)

## Error Handling

The controller implements robust error handling:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with other services if one fails
- **Error Collection**: Collects all errors and warnings
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging at all levels
- **State Recovery**: Attempts to save state even if operations fail
- **Dry-Run Safety**: All operations support dry-run mode

## State Management

The controller uses StateManager for configuration persistence:

- **Local Storage**: Primary state file at `config/aws-resource-state.json`
- **S3 Backup**: Optional S3 backup for redundancy
- **Versioning**: State includes version and timestamp
- **Validation**: State validation before save/load
- **Backup**: Automatic backup of existing state file

## Cost Estimation

The controller provides cost estimation features:

- **Current Costs**: Calculates current hourly/daily/monthly costs
- **Savings Estimate**: Estimates savings from stop operation
- **Service Breakdown**: Cost breakdown by service
- **Recommendations**: Generates cost optimization recommendations

## Verification

The controller includes resource verification:

- **Post-Start Verification**: Verifies resources are operational after start
- **Status Checks**: Checks each service manager for proper state
- **Warning Generation**: Generates warnings for any issues found

## Recommendations Engine

The controller generates intelligent recommendations:

- **High Cost Alert**: Warns if monthly costs exceed $10
- **Stopped Resources**: Alerts when all resources are stopped
- **Minimal Capacity**: Warns about Kinesis at minimal capacity
- **Disabled Functions**: Alerts about Lambda functions with concurrency 0
- **Disabled Alarms**: Warns about disabled CloudWatch alarms

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Stop All Resources (Dry Run)
```python
controller = ResourceController(dry_run=True)
result = controller.stop_all_resources()
print(f"Would save ${result.cost_impact:.2f}/day")
```

### Example 2: Start All Resources
```python
controller = ResourceController()
result = controller.start_all_resources()
if result.success:
    print(f"Started {len(result.resources_affected)} resources")
```

### Example 3: Get Status
```python
controller = ResourceController()
report = controller.get_resource_status()
print(f"Monthly cost: ${report.estimated_monthly_cost:.2f}")
for rec in report.recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec}")
```

### Example 4: Save and Restore State
```python
controller = ResourceController()

# Save current state
controller.save_state()

# Later, restore state
controller.restore_state()
```

## Testing

Created test files:
- `test_controller.py` - Unit tests for controller functionality
- `example_controller.py` - Usage examples and demonstrations

## Requirements Met

All task requirements have been successfully implemented:

✅ **4.1 Create resource controller module**
- Created `controller.py` with ResourceController class
- Initialized all service managers (Kinesis, Lambda, CloudWatch)
- Added resource identification by project tags

✅ **4.2 Implement stop_all_resources method**
- Calls stop on all service managers in correct order
- Saves resource state before stopping
- Handles errors and continues with other resources
- Generates operation report
- Supports dry-run mode

✅ **4.3 Implement start_all_resources method**
- Loads saved resource state
- Calls start on all service managers in correct order
- Verifies each resource is operational after starting
- Generates operation report
- Supports dry-run mode

✅ **4.4 Implement get_resource_status method**
- Queries status from all service managers
- Calculates total estimated costs
- Generates status report with resource details
- Identifies idle resources
- Provides optimization recommendations

## Next Steps

The controller is ready for integration with the CLI script (`scripts/aws-resource-manager.sh`). The CLI will use this controller to provide command-line interface for:
- `stop` - Stop all resources
- `start` - Start all resources
- `status` - Get resource status
