# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves separating the current monolithic React application into two distinct applications to improve user experience, security, and maintainability. Currently, both end-users and internal analytics teams access the same application with different routes, which creates potential security concerns and mixed user experiences.

The separation will create a dedicated user-facing application for real-time interactions and a specialized analytics dashboard for internal team analysis, each optimized for their specific use cases and user personas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an end-user, I want a dedicated application focused on my interactions and experience, so that I have a clean, fast, and purpose-built interface without unnecessary analytics complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an end-user accesses the user application THEN the system SHALL provide only user-focused features (demo scenarios, interactive calculator, video library, document upload)
2. WHEN an end-user navigates the application THEN the system SHALL NOT expose any internal analytics dashboards or administrative features
3. WHEN an end-user interacts with the application THEN the system SHALL track events seamlessly without displaying analytics data
4. IF an end-user attempts to access analytics routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to appropriate user-focused pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an internal analytics team member, I want a dedicated analytics dashboard application, so that I can focus on data analysis and insights without user application distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an analytics team member accesses the dashboard application THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive analytics features (metrics overview, user journey charts, struggle signals, segmentation)
2. WHEN an analytics team member logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them with appropriate permissions for analytics access
3. WHEN an analytics team member views data THEN the system SHALL display real-time analytics with filtering, export, and AI chat capabilities
4. WHEN an analytics team member uses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide advanced features like data export, Amazon Q integration, and detailed reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want separate deployment and configuration for both applications, so that I can manage, scale, and secure each application independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying applications THEN the system SHALL support independent deployment of user and analytics applications
2. WHEN configuring applications THEN the system SHALL allow separate environment configurations for each application
3. WHEN scaling applications THEN the system SHALL enable independent scaling based on different usage patterns
4. WHEN securing applications THEN the system SHALL implement different authentication and authorization strategies for each application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared components and services between applications, so that I can maintain code consistency while avoiding duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL provide shared TypeScript types and interfaces
2. WHEN implementing services THEN the system SHALL allow reusable API services and utilities
3. WHEN styling applications THEN the system SHALL support shared design system components
4. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL enable shared build configurations and dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want seamless data flow between applications, so that user interactions in the main app are properly tracked and analyzed in the analytics dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the main application THEN the system SHALL send events to the analytics backend
2. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL make data available to the analytics dashboard in real-time
3. WHEN analytics team views data THEN the system SHALL display events from the user application with proper correlation
4. WHEN data flows between applications THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
