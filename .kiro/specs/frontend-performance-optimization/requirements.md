# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is experiencing performance issues, specifically with the First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric. The monitoring system is detecting slow page load times and reporting them as errors. This feature aims to optimize the frontend performance to improve user experience and reduce performance-related error reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly, so that I can start interacting with the content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application THEN the First Contentful Paint SHALL occur within 1.8 seconds
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the Largest Contentful Paint SHALL occur within 2.5 seconds
3. WHEN performance metrics are measured THEN the Cumulative Layout Shift SHALL be less than 0.1

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks, so that I can optimize the most impactful areas first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the application THEN the system SHALL identify bundle size issues that impact load time
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL detect unnecessary re-renders and expensive operations
3. WHEN examining assets THEN the system SHALL identify unoptimized images and resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain responsive during interactions, so that my actions feel immediate and smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the response time SHALL be less than 100ms
2. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the frame rate SHALL maintain 60fps
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the transition SHALL complete within 200ms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring to provide actionable insights, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the monitoring system SHALL provide specific metrics and context
2. WHEN thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed performance data for analysis
3. WHEN errors are reported THEN they SHALL include sufficient information to identify the root cause

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to optimize assets automatically, so that performance improvements are built into the deployment pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN JavaScript bundles SHALL be code-split and optimized
2. WHEN processing assets THEN images SHALL be compressed and served in modern formats
3. WHEN generating the build THEN unused code SHALL be eliminated through tree-shaking
