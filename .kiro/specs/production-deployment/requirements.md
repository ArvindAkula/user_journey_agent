# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the deployment of the user journey analytics system to production with real-time data capabilities. The system currently runs in local development mode using LocalStack and mock services. The production deployment will integrate with real AWS services, Firebase authentication, and provide live analytics data from actual user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the analytics system to production with real AWS services, so that I can collect and analyze real user journey data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed in production mode THEN it SHALL connect to real AWS DynamoDB instead of LocalStack
2. WHEN the system is deployed in production mode THEN it SHALL use real AWS Kinesis streams for event processing
3. WHEN the system is deployed in production mode THEN it SHALL store data in real AWS S3 buckets
4. WHEN the system is deployed in production mode THEN it SHALL use real AWS SQS queues for message processing
5. WHEN the system is deployed in production mode THEN it SHALL disable all mock modes and LocalStack endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want the analytics dashboard to display real-time user data, so that I can monitor actual user behavior and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the production user application THEN their events SHALL be captured and sent to Kinesis streams
2. WHEN events are processed through the pipeline THEN they SHALL be stored in DynamoDB within 5 seconds
3. WHEN the analytics dashboard is accessed THEN it SHALL display real user data instead of dummy data
4. WHEN new user events occur THEN the dashboard SHALL update within 10 seconds to reflect the new data
5. IF the event pipeline fails THEN events SHALL be queued in the dead letter queue for retry processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration management, so that I can easily switch between development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in production mode THEN it SHALL load production-specific configuration files
2. WHEN production environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN no code changes SHALL be required, only configuration changes
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN all sensitive credentials SHALL be stored securely using environment variables
5. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on missing or invalid settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization in production, so that only authorized users can access the analytics dashboard and user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the user application THEN users SHALL authenticate via Firebase
2. WHEN accessing the analytics dashboard THEN administrators SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL include proper authentication headers
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses and log security events
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL throttle requests and return 429 status codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated infrastructure provisioning, so that I can deploy the required AWS resources consistently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure deployment is initiated THEN all required AWS resources SHALL be created automatically
2. WHEN DynamoDB tables are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate indexes and capacity settings
3. WHEN Kinesis streams are created THEN they SHALL have proper shard configuration for expected load
4. WHEN S3 buckets are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate security policies and lifecycle rules
5. WHEN SQS queues are created THEN they SHALL include dead letter queues and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running in production THEN all components SHALL log to centralized logging system
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels and context
3. WHEN system metrics exceed thresholds THEN alerts SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN monitoring dashboards are accessed THEN they SHALL show real-time system health metrics
5. IF critical services fail THEN automated notifications SHALL be sent to administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want data backup and disaster recovery capabilities, so that analytics data is protected and the system can recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored in DynamoDB THEN it SHALL be automatically backed up daily
2. WHEN S3 data is created THEN it SHALL be replicated to multiple availability zones
3. WHEN system components fail THEN they SHALL automatically restart and recover
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL be restorable within 4 hours
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN point-in-time recovery SHALL be available for the last 30 days
