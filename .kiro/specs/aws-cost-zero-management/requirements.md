# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides comprehensive AWS cost management capabilities to achieve zero AWS billing when resources are not actively needed. The system enables administrators to stop all billable AWS services with a single command and start them on-demand, ensuring cost optimization while maintaining the ability to quickly restore full functionality for demos, development, or production use.

## Glossary

- **Cost Management System**: The automated tooling that controls AWS resource lifecycle
- **Resource Controller**: Scripts that manage starting and stopping of AWS services
- **Billable Resources**: AWS services that incur charges (Lambda, SageMaker, Kinesis, etc.)
- **State Persistence**: Mechanism to save and restore resource configurations
- **Zero-Cost Mode**: State where all billable AWS resources are stopped or deleted
- **On-Demand Mode**: State where resources are created and running as needed
- **Resource Inventory**: Complete list of all AWS resources managed by the system
- **Cost Threshold**: Maximum acceptable AWS spending limit

6. WHEN THE administrator executes the start command, THE Cost Management System SHALL verify that all resources are operational before completing
7. WHEN THE administrator executes the start command, THE Cost Management System SHALL generate a status report showing which resources were successfully started

### Requirement 3

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator executes the status command, THE Cost Management System SHALL list all AWS resources with their current state
2. WHEN THE administrator executes the status command, THE Cost Management System SHALL display the estimated hourly and daily cost for each active resource
3. WHEN THE administrator executes the status command, THE Cost Management System SHALL calculate and display the total estimated monthly cost
4. WHEN THE administrator executes the status command, THE Cost Management System SHALL identify resources that are running but not actively used
5. WHEN THE administrator executes the status command, THE Cost Management System SHALL provide recommendations for cost optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to schedule automatic shutdown and startup of resources, so that costs are minimized during non-business hours without manual intervention

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator configures a shutdown schedule, THE Cost Management System SHALL create CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger automatic shutdown
2. WHEN THE administrator configures a startup schedule, THE Cost Management System SHALL create CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger automatic startup
3. WHEN THE scheduled shutdown time occurs, THE Cost Management System SHALL execute the stop command automatically
4. WHEN THE scheduled startup time occurs, THE Cost Management System SHALL execute the start command automatically
5. WHEN THE automatic shutdown or startup completes, THE Cost Management System SHALL send notification via SNS to configured email addresses
6. WHEN THE administrator disables scheduling, THE Cost Management System SHALL remove all CloudWatch Event Rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set cost thresholds and receive alerts, so that I can prevent unexpected AWS charges

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator sets a cost threshold, THE Cost Management System SHALL create AWS Budget alerts for the specified amount
2. WHEN THE actual costs exceed 80 percent of the threshold, THE Cost Management System SHALL send a warning notification
3. WHEN THE actual costs exceed 100 percent of the threshold, THE Cost Management System SHALL send a critical alert notification
4. WHEN THE actual costs exceed 100 percent of the threshold, THE Cost Management System SHALL optionally trigger automatic resource shutdown
5. WHEN THE administrator queries current spending, THE Cost Management System SHALL retrieve and display actual costs from AWS Cost Explorer

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage resources in different modes (development, demo, production), so that I can optimize costs based on usage patterns

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE THE system is in development mode, THE Cost Management System SHALL use minimal resource configurations
2. WHERE THE system is in demo mode, THE Cost Management System SHALL enable only resources required for demonstrations
3. WHERE THE system is in production mode, THE Cost Management System SHALL maintain full resource availability and redundancy
4. WHEN THE administrator switches modes, THE Cost Management System SHALL adjust resource configurations accordingly
5. WHEN THE administrator switches modes, THE Cost Management System SHALL update all environment variables and configuration files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to preserve data while stopping services, so that no information is lost during cost optimization

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Cost Management System stops resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL ensure all DynamoDB data remains intact
2. WHEN THE Cost Management System stops resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL ensure all S3 data remains intact
3. WHEN THE Cost Management System stops resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL create snapshots of CloudWatch log groups before deletion
4. WHEN THE Cost Management System stops resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL export Kinesis stream configurations before disabling
5. WHEN THE Cost Management System restarts resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL verify data integrity across all storage services

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform dry-run operations, so that I can preview changes before executing them

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator executes a command with dry-run flag, THE Cost Management System SHALL simulate the operation without making changes

5. WHEN THE administrator executes a command with dry-run flag, THE Cost Management System SHALL provide a summary of actions that would be taken

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage specific resource groups independently, so that I can stop only certain services while keeping others running

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator specifies a resource group, THE Cost Management System SHALL operate only on resources within that group
2. WHERE THE administrator targets compute resources, THE Cost Management System SHALL manage Lambda and SageMaker only
