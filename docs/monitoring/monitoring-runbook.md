## System Health Monitoring

### Daily Health Checks

**Frequency:** Daily (automated via CloudWatch dashboards)

**Procedure:**
1. Access CloudWatch Dashboard: `user-journey-analytics-system-health-{environment}`
2. Review key metrics:
   - User Events Processed (should be > 0 if system is active)
   - Lambda Function Errors (should be < 5% of invocations)
   - DynamoDB Throttles (should be 0)
   - AI Service Errors (should be < 2% of calls)
   - Processing Latency (should be < 5 seconds average)

**Expected Values:**
- Event Processing Rate: > 10 events/15min during active hours
- Lambda Error Rate: < 5%
- DynamoDB Throttles: 0
- AI Service Success Rate: > 98%
- End-to-End Latency: < 5 seconds

**Escalation:** If any metric exceeds threshold for > 15 minutes, proceed to alert response procedures.

### Weekly Performance Review

**Frequency:** Weekly

**Procedure:**
1. Access Performance Dashboard: `user-journey-analytics-performance-{environment}`
2. Review trends:
   - Processing latency trends
   - Lambda concurrency patterns
   - Stream processing lag
   - Resource utilization patterns

**Actions:**
- Document any performance degradation trends
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Plan capacity adjustments if needed

## Alert Response Procedures

### High Priority Alerts

#### Lambda Function Errors (> 5 errors in 5 minutes)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check CloudWatch Logs for the affected Lambda function
2. Identify error patterns using CloudWatch Insights query:
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message, @requestId
   | filter @message like /ERROR/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```
3. Check X-Ray traces for distributed tracing information
4. Verify upstream dependencies (Kinesis, DynamoDB, AI services)

**Common Causes & Solutions:**
- **Timeout Errors:** Increase Lambda timeout or optimize code
- **Memory Errors:** Increase Lambda memory allocation
- **Throttling:** Check concurrent execution limits
- **Dependency Failures:** Verify AWS service status

**Escalation:** If errors persist > 15 minutes, engage development team.

#### AI Service Errors (> 3 errors in 5 minutes)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check Bedrock service status in AWS Health Dashboard
2. Review AI service usage patterns in AI Services Dashboard
3. Check for throttling or quota limits
4. Verify service configurations and permissions

**Common Causes & Solutions:**
- **Throttling:** Implement exponential backoff, request quota increase
- **Invalid Requests:** Check request format and parameters
- **Service Outage:** Implement fallback mechanisms
- **Quota Exceeded:** Monitor usage and request limit increases

#### High Processing Latency (> 10 seconds average)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check Processing Latency dashboard
2. Identify bottlenecks using X-Ray service map
3. Review Lambda function performance metrics
4. Check DynamoDB and Kinesis performance

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Analyze X-Ray traces for slow components
2. Check CloudWatch Insights for performance patterns:
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @duration, @billedDuration
   | filter @type = "REPORT"
   | stats avg(@duration), max(@duration) by bin(5m)
   ```
3. Review resource utilization metrics

### Medium Priority Alerts

#### Low Event Processing Rate (< 10 events in 15 minutes)

**Investigation:**
1. Check if this is expected (e.g., low user activity)
2. Verify Kinesis stream health
3. Check Lambda function invocations
4. Review event source configurations

#### DynamoDB Throttling

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check DynamoDB metrics for affected tables
2. Review read/write capacity utilization
3. Identify hot partitions if applicable
4. Consider enabling auto-scaling or increasing capacity

#### Cost Anomalies

**Investigation:**
1. Review Cost Monitoring Dashboard
2. Identify services with unexpected cost increases
3. Check for resource scaling events
4. Review usage patterns for anomalies

## Performance Troubleshooting

### Lambda Function Performance

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check function duration and memory usage
2. Review cold start frequency
3. Analyze X-Ray traces for bottlenecks
4. Check concurrent execution patterns

**Optimization Actions:**
- Increase memory allocation for CPU-bound functions
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize code for reduced cold starts
- Consider provisioned concurrency for critical functions

### DynamoDB Performance

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check consumed capacity vs. provisioned capacity
2. Review throttling metrics
3. Analyze access patterns for hot partitions
4. Check GSI performance

**Optimization Actions:**
- Enable auto-scaling
- Optimize partition key design
- Use projection in GSIs to reduce data transfer
- Consider DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read-heavy workloads

### Kinesis Stream Performance

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check iterator age metrics
2. Review shard utilization
3. Monitor incoming vs. outgoing records
4. Check consumer lag

**Optimization Actions:**
- Increase shard count if needed
- Optimize batch size for consumers
- Implement parallel processing
- Consider Kinesis Scaling Utility

## Cost Monitoring

### Daily Cost Review

**Procedure:**
1. Access Cost Monitoring Dashboard
2. Review daily spend by service
3. Compare against budget thresholds
4. Identify any cost anomalies

**Budget Thresholds:**
- Demo Environment: $300/month
- Development: $500/month  
- Production: $1000/month

### Cost Optimization Actions

**Lambda Optimization:**
