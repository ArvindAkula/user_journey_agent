title AI Agent Workflows - User Journey Analytics

participant "User" as user
participant "Frontend App" as frontend
participant "Event Processor" as processor
participant "Feature Engineering" as features
participant "SageMaker Endpoint" as sagemaker
participant "Bedrock Agent" as agent
participant "Struggle Detector" as struggle
participant "Video Analyzer" as video
participant "Intervention Executor" as intervention
participant "Notification System" as notify

== Struggle Detection Workflow ==

user -> frontend : Performs action with difficulty
frontend -> processor : Send struggle event
processor -> features : Extract behavior features
features -> sagemaker : Calculate exit risk
sagemaker -> agent : Risk score + context

agent -> struggle : Analyze struggle pattern
struggle -> struggle : Assess severity & history
struggle -> agent : Analysis + recommendations

alt High Risk Detected
    agent -> intervention : Execute critical intervention
    intervention -> notify : Send immediate alerts
    intervention -> notify : Notify support team
    notify -> user : Push notification
    note right: **Critical Path**\n• Immediate response\n• Support team alert\n• Live chat offer
else Medium Risk
    agent -> intervention : Execute standard intervention
    intervention -> notify : Send helpful resources
    notify -> user : Email with guidance
    note right: **Standard Path**\n• Resource email\n• Progress monitoring\n• Follow-up scheduled
else Low Risk
    agent -> intervention : Execute gentle guidance
    intervention -> frontend : Trigger in-app help
    frontend -> user : Show contextual tips
    note right: **Gentle Path**\n• In-app guidance\n• Progress encouragement\n• Passive monitoring
end

== Video Engagement Analysis Workflow ==

user -> frontend : Watches video content
frontend -> processor : Video engagement events
processor -> features : Update engagement metrics

agent -> video : Analyze engagement patterns
video -> video : Calculate engagement scores
video -> video : Identify content preferences
video -> agent : Engagement analysis

alt High Engagement
    agent -> intervention : Recommend advanced content
    intervention -> notify : Send next-level resources
    note right: **Progression Path**\n• Advanced content\n• Certification offers\n• Success reinforcement
else Low Engagement
    agent -> intervention : Improve content strategy
    intervention -> notify : Send alternative content
    note right: **Re-engagement Path**\n• Simplified content\n• Different formats\n• Preference survey
end

== Proactive Intervention Workflow ==

loop Continuous Monitoring
    features -> sagemaker : Batch risk assessment
    sagemaker -> agent : User risk scores
    
    agent -> agent : Identify at-risk users
    
    alt Critical Risk Users
        agent -> intervention : Execute emergency interventions
        intervention -> notify : Priority support alerts
        note right: **Emergency Protocol**\n• Immediate human contact\n• Escalation procedures\n• Success tracking
    else Moderate Risk Users
        agent -> intervention : Execute preventive interventions
        intervention -> notify : Proactive outreach
        note right: **Prevention Protocol**\n• Educational content\n• Check-in emails\n• Progress monitoring
    end
end

== Personalized Journey Orchestration ==

user -> frontend : Navigates application
frontend -> processor : Journey events
processor -> features : Update user context

agent -> agent : Analyze user intent
agent -> agent : Consider historical patterns
agent -> agent : Generate recommendations

agent -> intervention : Orchestrate next actions
intervention -> frontend : Personalized UI updates
intervention -> notify : Contextual notifications

frontend -> user : Personalized experience
notify -> user : Relevant communications
