# 🤖 AI Services Explained - Simple Guide

> Understanding Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, Nova Micro, and how AI powers this application

---

## 📚 What is Amazon Bedrock?

**Amazon Bedrock** is AWS's fully managed service that provides access to foundation models (large AI models) from leading AI companies through a single API.

### Key Features
- 🎯 **No Infrastructure Management** - Just call an API, AWS handles the rest
- 🚀 **Multiple AI Models** - Access models from Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Cohere, etc.
- 💰 **Pay-per-Use** - Only pay for what you use (per token/request)
- 🔒 **Secure & Private** - Your data stays in your AWS account

### In This Project
We use Bedrock to access **Amazon Nova Micro** for real-time user journey analysis.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes user behavior patterns
- Generates intervention recommendations
- Provides natural language insights
- Makes decisions in 2-3 seconds

---

## 🧠 What is Amazon Nova Micro?

**Amazon Nova Micro** is Amazon's newest, fastest, and most cost-effective foundation model, specifically designed for real-time applications.

### Why Nova Micro?

| Feature | Nova Micro | Other Models (Claude, GPT) |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Speed** | 2-3 seconds | 5-10 seconds |
| **Cost** | $0.000035/1K tokens | $0.003-0.015/1K tokens |
| **Approval** | Instant access | Requires use-case form |
| **Use Case** | Real-time decisions | Complex reasoning |

### Perfect For
- ✅ Real-time user analysis
- ✅ Quick decision making
- ✅ High-volume requests
- ✅ Cost-sensitive applications

### In This Project
Nova Micro analyzes user events and decides:
- Is the user struggling?
- What's their exit risk score (0-100)?
- Should we trigger an intervention?
- What message should we show?

---

## 🌊 What is Amazon Kinesis?

**Amazon Kinesis** is AWS's real-time data streaming service that collects, processes, and analyzes streaming data at scale.

### Key Features
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing** - Process data as it arrives (milliseconds)
- 📈 **Scalable** - Handles thousands of events per second
- 🔄 **Durable** - Data retained for 24 hours to 7 days
- 🎯 **Ordered** - Events processed in the order they arrive

### How It Works
Think of Kinesis as a **high-speed conveyor belt** for data:
```
Events → Kinesis Stream → Lambda/Consumers → Processing
```

### In This Project
Kinesis acts as the **event pipeline** between frontend and AI processing.

**What it does:**
- Receives user events from backend
- Buffers events for processing
- Triggers Lambda functions automatically
- Ensures no events are lost
- Handles traffic spikes gracefully

### Why Kinesis?

| Without Kinesis | With Kinesis |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Backend calls Lambda directly | Kinesis buffers and triggers Lambda |
| Lost events if Lambda fails | Events retained for retry |
| Can't handle traffic spikes | Auto-scales to any volume |
| Tight coupling | Decoupled architecture |

### Real-World Analogy
**Without Kinesis:** Like calling someone directly - if they don't answer, message is lost.

**With Kinesis:** Like leaving a voicemail - message is saved, they can listen later, and you can leave multiple messages that get processed in order.

## 🎓 What is Amazon SageMaker?

**Amazon SageMaker** is AWS's comprehensive machine learning platform for building, training, and deploying custom ML models.

### Key Capabilities
- 🏗️ **Build Models** - Jupyter notebooks, AutoML, built-in algorithms
- 🎯 **Train Models** - Distributed training, hyperparameter tuning
- 🚀 **Deploy Models** - Real-time endpoints, batch processing
- 📊 **Monitor Models** - Track accuracy, detect drift, retrain

### In This Project
We use SageMaker to deploy a **custom exit risk prediction model**.

**What it does:**
- Predicts probability of user leaving (0-100%)
- Uses historical behavior patterns
- Trained on real user data
- Provides predictions in <500ms

### Why Custom Model?
- More accurate for our specific use case (85%+ accuracy)
- Optimized for our data patterns
- Can be retrained with new data
- Full control over features and logic

## 🔄 How AI Analysis Works - Simple Flow

### Step 1: User Action
```
User interacts with calculator
  ↓
Frontend tracks event
  ↓
Event sent to backend API
```

### Step 2: Event Processing
```
Backend receives event
  ↓
Validates and enriches data
  ↓
Sends to Kinesis stream
  ↓
Stored in DynamoDB
```

### Step 3: AI Analysis (Lambda + Bedrock)
```
Lambda function triggered by Kinesis
  ↓
Retrieves last 20 user events
  ↓
Sends to Amazon Bedrock (Nova Micro)
  ↓
Nova analyzes patterns:
  - How many struggles?
  - Time spent on page?
  - Completion rate?
  ↓
Returns analysis:
  - Exit risk score: 75
  - Engagement level: low
  - Recommended action: offer help
  ↓
Stores in struggle-signals table
```

### Step 4: Intervention Decision (Backend)
```
Frontend polls backend every 5 seconds
  ↓
Backend checks struggle-signals table
  ↓
Finds exit risk score ≥ 75
  ↓
Returns intervention event
```

### Step 5: User Sees Popup
```
Frontend receives intervention
  ↓
Shows live chat popup
  ↓
User can accept or decline
```

## 🎯 Real Example: User Struggles with Calculator

### Timeline

**00:00** - User visits calculator page
```javascript
Event: page_view
→ Stored in DynamoDB
```

**00:15** - User enters loan amount
```javascript
Event: feature_interaction
→ Stored in DynamoDB
```

**00:30** - User struggles (multiple attempts)
```javascript
Event: struggle_signal
→ Stored in DynamoDB
→ Lambda triggered
```

**00:32** - Lambda calls Bedrock Nova
```
Prompt: "Analyze this user journey:
- 1 page_view
- 1 feature_interaction  
- 1 struggle_signal
- Time spent: 30 seconds
- Attempts: 3

Provide exit risk score and recommendations."
```

**00:34** - Nova responds (2 seconds)
```json
{
  "exit_risk_score": 75,
  "engagement_level": "low",
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Offer live chat support",
    "Show helpful tooltip"
  ],
  "key_insights": "User struggling with form inputs"
}
```

**00:35** - Stored in struggle-signals table
```javascript
{
  userId: "demo-user",
  exitRiskScore: 75,
  severity: "high",
  signalType: "ai_journey_analysis"
}
```

**00:40** - Frontend polls backend
```javascript
GET /api/interventions/demo-user/pending
```

**00:40** - Backend finds high risk
```javascript
Response: {
  hasPendingIntervention: true,
  intervention: {
    type: "critical_intervention",
    action: "show_live_chat_popup",
    payload: {
      riskScore: 75,
      riskLevel: "high"
    }
  }
}
```

**00:41** - Popup appears
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  💬 Need Help?              │
│                             │
│  We noticed you might be    │
│  having some difficulty.    │
│                             │
│  [Start Live Chat]          │
│  [Maybe Later]              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
